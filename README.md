# About

Welcome to On The Blog! Where users can create their own blogs about anything they want!

## Installation

To get this application up and running, you'll need to fork and clone this repo, along with the [on-the-blog-frontend](https://github.com/JarbiBonilla/on-the-blog-frontend).

You will need to have SQLite and Rails installed.
* Run your SQLite server for the DB.
* Run the rails server from the on-the-blog-backend.
* You'll need to cd into the project directory and run ``bundle install``. All the gem dependancies will then be installed.

## Database Creation
Navigate to the on-the-blog-backend folder and run the following:

* rails db:create
* rails db:migrate
* rails db:seed

## Dependencies 

 * [Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/) - backend API
